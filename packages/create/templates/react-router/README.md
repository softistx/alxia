# Welcome to React Router!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/default)

## Features

- 🚀 Server-side rendering
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
bun dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
bun run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

The build is production-ready and self-contained: `bun run start` runs `build/server/index.js` on Bun, with every dependency bundled into it, so `build/` needs no `node_modules`.

Make sure to deploy the output of `bun run build`

```
├── package.json
├── bun.lock
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Lint and format

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev) lints and formats the project, as `biome.json`
sets it: Biome's recommended rules, spaces, double quotes, imports
sorted. What the build and `react-router typegen` write, `build/` and
`.react-router/`, is skipped.

```bash
bun run check      # lint, format and sort imports, fixing what it can
bun run lint       # lint only
bun run format     # format only, in place
bun run check:ci   # what CI runs: changes nothing, fails on any finding
bun run verify     # check:ci, then typecheck, then build
```

`bun run check:ci`, not `bun ci`: `bun ci` is Bun's frozen-lockfile
install. In VS Code, `.vscode/` recommends Biome's extension and formats
on save with it.

`@biomejs/biome` is pinned exactly, since a release of Biome may format
differently. To move it:

```bash
bun add --dev --exact @biomejs/biome@latest
bunx biome migrate --write
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
