# @alxia/zod

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#151](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/pull/151) [`815211b`](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/commit/815211bb38525dd5d0f97265c1f1ebe14b5a3787) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - Remove `zodConverter`, deprecated since nothing in alxia reads it. Use Zod's own `z.toJSONSchema(schema)`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#134](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/pull/134) [`c503098`](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/commit/c503098a652439d816a56f2d731b61015d8237bd) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The examples are written in `@alxia/core`'s middleware model: a route's body or query is validated by `validate({ … })` and its replies by `responds({ … })`, among its middlewares, in place of a schema before the handler.

- [#134](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/pull/134) [`c503098`](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/commit/c503098a652439d816a56f2d731b61015d8237bd) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - The docs no longer use `@alxia/client`, which is retired: alxia is OpenAPI spec first, and a typed client is generated from the API's OpenAPI document. The examples call the app with `app.request()`.

- [#134](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/pull/134) [`c503098`](https://github.com/softistx/alxia/commit/c503098a652439d816a56f2d731b61015d8237bd) Thanks [@SteveGT96](https://github.com/SteveGT96)! - `zodConverter` is marked `@deprecated`: it served the `convert` option of the retired `@alxia/openapi` document writer, and nothing in alxia reads it any more. It stays exported and unchanged; Zod's own `z.toJSONSchema` does the same.

Its docs no longer name the retired `@alxia/openapi` document writer: it is a Zod schema as JSON Schema 2020-12, as it crosses the wire.
