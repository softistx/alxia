For `@alxia/core` 0.5: the middleware's exported type is a plain `(ctx, next)` function, without `MiddlewareMark`, and `app.plugin(x())`, deprecated in 0.4, is gone: give the middleware to `use(...)`. The docs show the single form, and an error is answered by a `try`/`catch` middleware where they showed `onError`.
